# Major_League_Baseball
Advanced SQL querying techniques are used to track how player statistics have changed over time and across different teams in Major League Baseball (MLB). The dataset includes information such as schools attended, salaries, teams played for, height, weight, and more.

# Main objective

- What schools do MLB players attend?

- How much do teams spend on player salaries?

- What does each playerâ€™s career look like?

- How do player attributes compare?
